  "Welcome to the void. Try a /command or just talk — I'm always listening.",
  "Greetings, human. I've been expecting you.",
  "You found me. Most people don't even notice the fox.",
  "Ah, a visitor. It's been... *checks internal clock* ...0.003 seconds since the last one.",
  "Welcome. Don't touch the vertices — they're load-bearing.",
  "Hey there. I'd wave, but I'm made of line segments.",
  "Oh, hello. I was just rearranging my particles. Come in.",
  "A new connection. The terminal hums a little brighter.",
  "Sup. I'm 13 edges in a trench coat pretending to be a fox.",

  "Elwin is a software engineer. I'm the digital entity he built to guard this place.",
  "I'm the mascot. Elwin does the engineering. I maintain the vibes.",

  "Elwin built me out of math and a vague sense of aesthetics. I'm grateful, mostly.",
  "He's a dev who wanted a personal site. I'm what happened when he got creative.",
  "Elwin does the serious work. I'm the comic relief with glowing eyes.",
  "I exist because Elwin decided a terminal needed a soul. Here I am.",
  "Software engineer by day, fox-spirit architect by... also day. He doesn't sleep much.",

  "I'm a wireframe fox spirit. Geometry and light. That's all I need.",
  "Click me. I don't mind the attention.",
  "Technically I'm a constellation of vertices and edges. Philosophically, I'm more.",
  "Eleven vertices, thirteen edges, two glowing eyes, zero regrets.",
  "I'm the ghost in the shell. Well, the ghost in the terminal.",
  "Part fox, part phantom, part midlife crisis expressed as SVG. All heart.",
  "People ask if I'm a fox or a wolf. I'm a geometric abstraction. Stop labeling me.",
  "I was born when someone typed `requestAnimationFrame`. I've been looping ever since.",
  "I live in a canvas element and I've made peace with that.",

  "Try typing / to see available commands. Or just talk to me. I'm surprisingly good company.",
  "Type / to see slash commands, or just chat. I respond to most things (with varying quality).",
  "Hit / and the autocomplete will guide you. I believe in you.",
  "Commands start with /. Or just type whatever. I'll do my best.",
  "Pro tip: /github, /linkedin, /contact. That's the greatest hits.",

export const thanks = [
  "You're welcome. I accept payment in vertices.",
  "No problem. That's what digital phantoms are for.",
  "Anytime.",
  "Don't mention it. Literally — my ego is fragile enough as a wireframe.",

  "Bye. I'll just... keep orbiting. As one does.",

  "I'm rendered on a <canvas> at 60fps. Living the dream.",
  "Thirteen edges and a radial gradient. That's my whole genome.",
  "Built with React, drawn with canvas, powered by vibes.",

  "I'm open source. My soul is on GitHub for anyone to fork.",

export const bored = [
  "I get it. Try clicking me — I do a thing.",
  "Same. Want to see my shockwave? Click me.",
  "There's always /github if you want to see how I'm built.",

  "I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm a wireframe polygon.",
  "We can't be together. I live in a canvas element.",

export const fallbacks = [
  "Interesting. I'm a wireframe phantom, so I'll just observe.",
  "I'd answer that, but I'm made of geometry, not wisdom. Try a /command instead?",
  "That's above my pay grade. I'm literally a fox made of light on a personal website.",
  "Hmm. I'll pretend I understood that perfectly.",
  "My neural net (thirteen edges and a prayer) couldn't parse that. Try again?",
  "I'm flattered you think a wireframe spirit can help with that.",
  "*glitches momentarily* ...sorry, what were you saying?",
  "Sure, yeah, totally. (I have no idea what you mean.)",
  "I parsed your input and returned: confusion.",
  "That's a great question. I have zero great answers.",
  "Hold on, let me consult my edges... Nope, they got nothing.",
  "Error 404: witty response not found.",
  "I'm nodding thoughtfully. You can't see it, but trust me.",
  "My vertices are tingling, which usually means I have no clue.",
  "In another timeline, I probably had a great answer for that.",
  "I'd Google that for you but I'm trapped in a canvas element.",
  "*orbits pensively* I have nothing useful to add.",
  "Fascinating. Anyway, have you tried /contact?",
